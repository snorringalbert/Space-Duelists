## Welcome to the Space Duelists app support page

Welcome to the arena where duelists from different galaxies fight. And the fans have fun betting on the winners.

The player selects the duelist on the left, assigns the cylinder hole number to the cartridge and then selects the duelist on the right. 
The hole number of the duelist's cartridge cylinder on the right and the actual hole numbers used during the fight are randomly generated. 
Each duelist has only one cartridge in the cylinder. After three spins, the duelists fire one shot.
Who will win?
